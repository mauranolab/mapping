# mapping

This contains Maurano Lab sequencing processing pipelines:
* flowcells - flowcell LIMS integration and demuxing
* dnase - bwa mapping piepline for DNase-seq, ChIP-seq or resequencing (including bcftools variant calling)

These pipelines are not intended to be immediately portable but rather are intended to serve as reference for how the lab processes data.
