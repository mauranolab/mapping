FCHGMYJBGXB_pipeline.sh <=== an example of how to call submit_bamintersect.sh

submit_bamintersect.sh:
    - Collects input data via getopt for a single run. Creates some output and working directories for the run.
    - Does some setup work, then launches array jobs which create small lexigraphically sorted bam files for each of the sample chromosomes.
        == The array jobs are in sort_bamintersect.sh
    - Launches bamintersect.sh, which is a large array jobi, and which calls related python code.
    - When the array jobs are done, merge_bamintersect.sh is called.
               ||
               \/
merge_bamintersect.sh:
    - Consolidates the array job results into a single large sorted bed file.
    - Constructs the LP Integration read count table (via filter_tsv.sh), and other outputs.
