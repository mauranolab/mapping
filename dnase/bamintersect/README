Overview of the code (there are 2 ways to launch it):

launch_pipeline.bash:                                                         call_one_sample.bash:
    - collects input data from files for multiple runs via a while loop           - an example of something that might be embedded in a larger program.
    - calls call_launch_bam_intersect.bash once for each loop                     - calls call_launch_bam_intersect.bash once
               ||                                                                       ||
               ||                                                                       //

call_launch_bam_intersect.bash:
    - Collects input data via getopt for a single run. Creates some output and working directories for the run.
    - Does some setup work, then launches array jobs which create small lexigraphically sorted bam files for each of the sample chromosomes.
        == The array jobs are in sort_chrom_.sbatch
    - Does some more setup work (calling prep_big_array_job.sbatch as well).
    - Launches bam_intersect_array.sbatch, which is a large array job.
    - When the array jobs are done, cleanup.sbatch is called.
               ||
               \/
cleanup.sbatch:
    - Consolidates the array job results into a single large sorted bed file.
    - Constructs the LP Integration read count table (via filter_tsv.bash), and other outputs.
